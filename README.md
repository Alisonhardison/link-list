# Coding Challenges

## Challenge: Linked list #1
  - Building, using and transforming a complex data structure: a Linked List. Specifically this challenge reversed a Linked List. This challenge also involved leveraging a new data structure, a stack, to help perform the reversal.

## Challenge: Linked list #2
  - Introduced the concept of a Linked List and performed a transformation on the data structure to build a new Linked List that was the reversed list. In this challenge, the linked list was reversed using mutation to modify the initial list that is provided.
